In 2012 I began to dabble in programming, which as a trainee technical support guy I had never touched before. My first outside-college project was the Unofficial giffgaff Helper. As I was an active helper on the giffgaff forums to raise money for fees I found that some obvious issues had a link that provided the exact information needed to fix the problem. However, this meant consulting a text document filled with links. I decided I could build a program that could do this for me, and the Unofficial giffgaff Helper was born.

The tool is very basic, all it did was copy a specific link to the clipboard. As the tool progressed it relied on a document that contained the links it used, and also provided a statusbar icon to provide quick links. Eventually, the tool even expanded to provide help to regular users as well as just helpers.

A couple of years later the project was abandoned over a large period of inactivity. I eventually became a junior developer in an organisation and coming back to this code with my experience now was a HORRIFYING experience. The code featured in this application is honestly horrible, and that's the reason why I've released it.

My biggest issue when exploring programming was how everything seemed so difficult. Programming was somewhat easy, but the logic behind how everything worked was just too difficult to grasp. I got an apprentice job within the programming sector which advanced into a career, and I wanted to show what my code was when I first began. Following that common MMORPG noob-comback, "You were new before". 

I completely withdraw all rights to the application, and anything remaining in the application will be down to the copyright giffgaff holds (e.g. resources). This is a complete backup from 2013, showing the latest version. I made a post in 2014 about version 2 was being created, however I am sorry to say I was unable to find the source code. The same goes for the Linux version, you may have known I famously lost the source code for the application five times.

Please ignore any jests or stupid comments, I was 17 when I first wrote the application.

## Technical Details
* **Project:** C# WinForms.
* **Architecture:** 32 bit Application. 
* **Environment:** Visual Studio 2010 C# Express.
* **.NET Framework:** 4.0 (to maintain XP support, which was still alive at the time).
* **Compiling:** Unknown (no Visual Studio installed, will change when installed).

Between 1 and 10 on the good practices scale, this application is at a 2. Intermediate developers prepare for nausea.
